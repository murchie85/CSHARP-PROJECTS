# SETUP  
  
- Install VSCode or VS 
- Download .NET	Core SDK [SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download)
- Install c# package --> view --> extensions

# NOTES 
**UWP APPS** Universal Windows Platfrom 
  
XCODE required to run on MAC.
  
VS is Windows and slower

# .NET FUNDAMENTALS
  
For Developers to build applications. Originally optimised for windows.  
.NET **is core to windows operating system** and installed on over one billion computers, this is why it must change as little as possible. So bugfixes and updates are infrequent. 

## Good Practice

Practically speaking, .NET Framework is Windows-only and a legacy platform. **Do not create new apps using it**  


### Three main .NET framworks 
  
- .NET Core
- .NET Framework
- .NET Standard 
  
Includes : 

1. Common Language Runtime (CLR), manages code execution
2. Base Class Library (BCL)


- Mono and Xamarin projects are community/open source Xamarin bought over. 

## .NET core 

.NET Core includes a cross-platform implementation of the CLR known as CoreCLR and a streamlined library of classes known as CoreFX.  
Fast moving, lots of changes; 'does not affect application stability' as it can be deployed side by side with an App.
